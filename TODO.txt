- figure out why SIGCHLD handler not decrementing running jobs; maybe impl by tracking PIDs of children
- startup states success even if it failed. fix this
- have stat show currently-running jobs in addition to those queued (hard since we cannot tell who finishes)
- have managers flush queues to log on keyboard interrupt (right now queues are lost)
- implement max time to block on submission pipe
- fix bug where squoted commands (e.g. in file) fail spectacularly
- 'git pull' executed by job manager fails because ssh agent expires after logout
- adaptive max-jobs-running based on available cpu resources
- periodic or on-demand flushing of jobs queued to a log
- better logging in general
