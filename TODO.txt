- be able to request manager startup if not already running (will assume tmux window exists)
- shutdown should also exit tmux session
- have stat show currently-running jobs in addition to those queued
- have managers flush queues to log on keyboard interrupt (right now queues are lost)
- implement max time to block on submission pipe
- fix bug where squoted commands (e.g. in file) fail spectacularly
- 'git pull' executed by job manager fails because ssh agent expires after logout
- adaptive max-jobs-running based on available cpu resources
- periodic or on-demand flushing of jobs queued to a log
- better logging in general
