- figure out why SIGCHLD handler not decrementing running jobs; maybe impl by
  tracking PIDs of children (NOTE: I think this is because multiple signals are
  delivered, but I think after the first delivery subsequent ones are
  idempotent as we're only setting the bit in some mask, so we only execute the
  handler once even though should be executing it multiple times...)
- have stat show currently-running jobs in addition to those queued (hard since we cannot tell who finishes)
- startup states success even if it failed. fix this
- have managers flush queues to log on keyboard interrupt (right now queues are lost)
- implement max time to block on submission pipe
- fix bug where squoted commands (e.g. in file) fail spectacularly
- 'git pull' executed by job manager fails because ssh agent expires after logout
- adaptive max-jobs-running based on available cpu resources
- periodic or on-demand flushing of jobs queued to a log
- better logging in general
